## Overview

Get your style sorted with My Wardrobe - an application that lets you plan, save and create your outfits at the touch of a button.

The simple way to stay organised, build you wardrobe by snapping pictures of your clothes and save them straight to the app. My Wardrobe also has an built-in calendar so you can schedule what you're going to wear and when. Making sure you never wear the same thing twice.
